# Codingame 2024
Antoine Poussier

to use the repository, make change and run the npmn script :

```bash
pnpm run copy-build
```

this will lunch the build.sh script that copy the requested files into an output, suppress imports and then copy the full content in the clipboard.

then you can just paste the content in your codingame web IDE.


if you create new files, add it in the build.sh script and be carefull on the import order.
